weirdNoises

This is a plugin for experimental musicians

————————————————————————————————————————————

To install, open weirdNoisesInstaller and follow the instructions.

Once in your DAW of choice, Ableton is recommended, scan for new VST3s. 

The company name it will be under is SoundsFromThePearTree. Open that, then select weirdNoises.

Once open, you will have buttons on the left labelled with different waveforms. Press these to add or remove said waveform. 

To the right of the buttons, there are amount (volume mix) and frequency. Add the waveforms you want and then pitch them so they sound as you wish. 

Below Square is the Pulse Width selection bar.

Below the oscillator section are the buttons that create interesting and random phrases for you when pressed. Be sure to press each button more than once to hear different variations!

When a button is pressed, the system will not allow anything else to happen until the process is finished. You may get Mac’s spinning beach ball.

‘Itch it’ will turn on and off waveforms, so set the waveforms you are not using’s pitches as well as the ones you are using. This is the only button you can press when none of the waveforms are selected and you will still get sound.

‘Scratch It’ tries to emulate a dj-style record scratching, with cuts and pitch downs and ups.

‘Garble It’ gives fast audio cuts with a more gradual amplitude fall and rise.

‘Gobble It’ gives fast audio cuts with a more gradual pitch fall and rise.
